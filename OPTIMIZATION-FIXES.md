## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues (Requires Source Code)

### Services Navigation Routing (React)

**Issue:** The "Services" link (`/massage-services`) routes to HomePage instead of MassageServicesPage.

**Location:** This is in the compiled React bundle (`assets/index-DG0wr7nC.js`)

**To Fix:**
1. Locate the React source code (src/ directory)
2. Find the routing configuration (likely in src/App.jsx or src/routes.jsx)
3. Update the route:
   ```jsx
   // INCORRECT (current)
   <Route path="/massage-services" element={<HomePage />} />
   
   // CORRECT (needed)
   <Route path="/massage-services" element={<MassageServicesPage />} />
   ```
4. Rebuild the React application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
5. Deploy the new build to the server

**Component exists but not wired:**
- File: `assets/MassageServicesPage-DhMRh7XJ.js` ‚úì EXISTS
- Just needs to be connected to the `/massage-services` route
